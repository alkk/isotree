    ---------------------
    IsoTree OOP interface
    ---------------------

    This is provided as an alternative easier-to-use interface for this library
    which follows scikit-learn-style methods with a single C++ class. It is a
    wrapper over the non-OOP header 'isotree.hpp', providing the same functionality
    in a perhaps more comprehensible structure, while still offering direct access
    to the underlying objects so as to allow using the functions from 'isotree.hpp'.
    
    It is a more limited interface as it does not implement all the functionality
    for serialization, distance prediction, oproducing predictions in the same call
    as the model is fit, or fitting/predicting on data with types other than
    'double' and 'int'.

    The descriptions here do not contain the full documentation, but rather only
    some hints so as to make them more comprehensible, aiming at producing function
    signatures that are self-descriptive instead (if you are familiar with the
    scikit-learn library for Python).
    
    For detailed documentation see the same or similar-looking methods in the
    'isotree.hpp' header instead.
